            this structure is a comment block in html files
            everything in this structure is NOT considered part of any 
                content of your web page

            Most tag elements in html are done in pairs
            These are called opening and closing pairs
            There are some tags that are not in pairs and are referred 
                to as empty tags(a.k.a void)
            The opening tag indicates the start of your element 
                and the closing tag indicates the end of your element
            The closing tag has the same name as the opening tag PLUS 
                a slash(/) proceeding the name 

            The head area of your web page is NOT considered content
            The tags within the head area are used by the browser to 
                manage some display of the page,give additional documentation
                to the page, indicate charactersets, help with search engines,
                and many other assists.

        <h3>Paragraph Tag</h3>
        <!--
            This is the coding block for your content in a paragraph
            The paragraph tag belongs to the "block" group of tags
            A "block" group tag places your content on a new line

            You can place all your paragraph text content on one physical
            line, however, that would require a lot of right and left.
            You can have a word wrap active in your editor and it will NOT affect
            how the browser displays your paragraph content. You can place
            your context on seperate lines yourself and it will NOT affect how
            the browser displays your paragraph content.
        -->
        <p>The paragraph tag is a block tag. A block tag begins a new line when
            the content is displayed by your browser. The browser does NOT display
            your content in your phisical style of how you have entered your code in
            html file. 
        </p>
        <p>This is a second paragraph on the browser page. It will start a new line.
            Did the Go Live update the browser display of my saved changes to the file?</p>
        
        <!-- 
            if you wish to use a component of a reserved tag (or the whole tag)
                you would be in trouble using the tag
            instead: you can use special character strings to represent components
                of the tag such as < (&lt;) and the greater than (&gt;) symbols
        -->

                    items in the list are indicated using the line item <li>
                    lists can be nested and mixed

            <h3>Anchor tag (a.k.a link to another page)</h3>
            <!--
                This is an anchor tag and is often incorrectly referred to as a link tag
                One should not use the phrase link tag because there is
                    actually a <link> tag used in the <head> area
                The anchor tag can take you to 
                        - a different web site
                        - a different web page within the same web site
                        - a different location on the same web page

                parameters:
                href: points to the desired location
                target: optional
                        deafault is same browser display page
                        _blank will open the destination in a new browser tab(page)
            -->
        <a href="https://www.nait.ca" target ="_blank">go to Nait</a>

        <h3>Image tag</h3>
        <!--
            Empty (void) tag
            The image tag does not have a closing tag because there is 
                no content to display
            parameters:
                src="relative web site location"
                alt="printable text if image is not found on file"
                [title="tool tip text for the image"]

            The relative path is from the top of your web site
                down/up to the file/page you desire to reference
            
            Down: include all subfolder names and the final file name
                sf1/sf2../fn
            
            UP: use the string .. to do up a level (subfolder)
                ../../sf1/fn
